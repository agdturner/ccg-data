# [agdt-java-data](https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic-data/)

A modularised Java library for processing data sets with classes for: data records; collections of data records; and identifiers.

- [Data_ReadTXT](https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-data/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/leeds/ccg/data/format/Data_ReadTXT.java) is a class for reading text including comma separated version (CSV) files.
- [Data_ReadXML](https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-data/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/ac/leeds/ccg/data/format/Data_ReadXML.java) is a class for reading XML format files.

## Code status
This code is unstable research software.

## Development plans/ideas
- Develop more comprehensive unit tests.
- Improve documentation.
- Make a versioned release on Maven Central.
- As the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) develops some of the functionality may become redundant.
- Consider if it is appropriate to [contribute](https://openjdk.java.net/contribute/) any of this.

## Development history
The intention is to provide a summary of changes from one version to the next here.
### Origin
This code began development bundled together with lots of other code developed for an academic research project.
